# CSS-disco
## A simple one-file CSS exercise

To begin, download this project to your local computer:
1. Click the big green "Clone or download" button at the top-right of this screen.
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Double-click the .zip file to unzip it 
4. Inside the folder "css-disco" you'll find two files:
    - README.md (that's this file with the instructions)
    - index.html (this is the file you need to edit with a tet editor like Brackets or Atom)
    
The sample webpage includes a button. When you click the button, a new "class" is applied to the `<body>` element. By targeting elements with CSS you can create new visual styles for the website's "initial" (when the page first loads) and "active" (after the button is clicked) states.

In other words, you can click the button and make things flash and change colors!

## Requirements
- Add at least one additional HTML element.
- Add CSS properties to change the appearance of the site in the "initial" and "active" states.
- Create a sense of surprise when the button is clicked.
